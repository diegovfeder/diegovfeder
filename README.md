# Hi there 👋

My name is Diego Feder and I'm a brazilian dev working remotely since covid 🙃

## About

👯* I’m currently working full-time as frontend and app engineer at Dextra. Here are some projects that I've had the opportunity to contribute:
  - AT&T TV Demo App
  - Tudobem (https://ficatudobem.com.br)
  - iCapitalNetwork (https://www.icapitalnetwork.com)

🌱 I also did some startup full-stack and IoT engineering work on [culltive.me](https://culltive.me/) an automated garden solution.

💥 Additionaly, I'm a very passionate creator as [grifemusic.com](https://grifemusic.com/) :)

💬 Ask me about anything I'd be happy to dialogue! You'll find me almost anywhere by @diegovfeder :dove:
